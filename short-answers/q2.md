# Question
Watch [this video on nodes and elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhvec8cXLlo)

What is the difference between an HTMLCollections and NodeLists? Are they arrays?

# Answer
    In HTMLCollections there are no array methods available. It updates automatically. Only HTML elements are available. 


    In NodeList, we can only use forEach. It does not update as often. It allows anything that has to do with the HTML document, such as comment, text, HTML elements etc. 



# Teacher Feedback

Make sure you answer all parts of the question, both are not arrays but are array-like meaning that they have indexing the same way an array would.
