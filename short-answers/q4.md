# Question
When would you want to use `.innerHTML` to create some new html, and when would you want to use `.createElement` and node updates?

# Answer
     We would want to use .innerHTML to create some new html when we want to access a specific element and change the context. 

    .createElement is used when we want to create a whole new element. Such as <p> <h1> etc. 
      
    It creates it but we must use other methods to add it to the website ex. .appendChild() to place it where we want it to. 

Example: 

    const para = document.createElement("p")
    
    para.innerText = "This is a paragraph"

      document.body.appendChild(para)
